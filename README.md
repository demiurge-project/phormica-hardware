# Phormica

This repository contains the design files for the UV-pheromone-module designed for the e-puck robot ([Salman et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.3389/frobt.2020.591402)). The module allows the e-puck to project variable-intensity and variable-width UV light on the floor in order to activate a photocromic substance which acts as an artificial pheromone.

The [Mechanical Design](https://github.com/demiurge-project/phormica-hardware/tree/master/Mechanical%20Design) directory contains the 3D model of the support structure for the module in STL format for 3D-printing purposes.

The [PCB Design](https://github.com/demiurge-project/phormica-hardware/tree/master/PCB%20Design) directory contains the production files for the custom-made PCB in Gerber format.
